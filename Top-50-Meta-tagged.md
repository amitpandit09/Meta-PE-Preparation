## Top meta tagged leetcode questions and its solution approaches

1. **Valid-palindrome-ii (680)** : Delete at most one character.
   1. Two Pointers (Greedy + Local Checks) – Optimal Approach TC = O(n), ST = O(n)
   2. Recursion with Backtracking - TC = O(n), ST = O(n)
   3. Brute Force with All Possible Deletions - TC = O(n^2), ST = O(n) per copy
2. **Binary Tree Right Side View (199)**  : Given the root of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.
   1. BFS - TC = O(n), ST = O(n)
   2. DFS - TC = O(n), ST = O(n)
3. [**Valid Word Abbreviation (408)**](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-word-abbreviation/description/?envType=company&envId=facebook&favoriteSlug=facebook-thirty-days) : A string can be abbreviated by replacing any number of non-adjacent, non-empty substrings with their lengths. The lengths should not have leading zeros
   1. Two-Pointer Parsing = TC = O(n + m), where n = word.length() and m = abbr.length(), Space: O(1)
   2. Backtracking with State = TC = O(2^n)
4. Binary Tree Vertical Order Traversal
   1. BFS - O(n) – each node is visited once
